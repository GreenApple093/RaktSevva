# RaktSevva: Blood Donation Management System

Welcome to **RaktSevva** — the ultimate solution for managing blood donation camps, blood bank inventories, and hospital requests all under one system. Sure, it may not win a design award, but who needs aesthetics when you've got function, right?

## 🚀 Project Overview

**RaktSevva** is designed to streamline the blood donation process by bridging the gap between donation camps, blood banks, and hospitals. It’s all about making the blood donation experience seamless, efficient, and accessible — minus the frills and sparkles. From real-time blood stock tracking to handling urgent hospital requests, **RaktSevva** offers a full-stack solution with robust backend functionality and ...a serviceable frontend.

## 🧩 Key Features

### Backend Awesomeness
- **Advanced SQL Triggers & Stored Procedures**: No ordinary CRUD here. The backend is equipped with SQL triggers and stored procedures to automate essential processes:
  - **Automatic Inventory Updates**: Triggers are in place to adjust blood bank stock automatically upon donations and withdrawals, ensuring real-time data consistency.
  - **Event-Based Notifications**: Stored procedures help generate and dispatch notifications to blood banks and hospitals when inventory drops below critical levels or new donation camps are scheduled. 
- **Custom Controllers and Efficient Routing**: Each component has well-organized controllers to handle specific tasks, optimizing server response times and making the code scalable.

### Comprehensive Management Dashboards
Each role has a dedicated dashboard with role-specific capabilities:
1. **Blood Bank Dashboard**: Manage stocks, view donation records, and process hospital requests in real-time.
2. **Hospital Dashboard**: Request blood, track requests, and receive timely updates on their fulfillment status.
3. **Donation Camp Dashboard**: Schedule events, monitor donations, and update event details in one unified place.

### Real-Time Status Updates
Utilizing SQL triggers, blood stocks are instantly updated when new donations are recorded or hospital requests are fulfilled. The backend notifies relevant users, so they’re always in the know, even if the frontend doesn't scream "modern design."


## 🛠️ Key Backend Challenges Tackled

1. **Dynamic Blood Stock Management**: We implemented SQL triggers and transactions to handle all blood inventory changes automatically. Whether a donation is added or a hospital request is processed, the stock levels update in real-time without manual intervention.

2. **Advanced SQL-Based Notification System**: Leveraging stored procedures and triggers, notifications are auto-generated for critical operations. For example, if blood stocks dip below a set threshold, the system immediately triggers alerts to hospitals in need.

3. **Error Handling and Data Consistency**: Robust error handling and rollback mechanisms ensure data integrity even in the event of concurrent updates. If a hospital request fails, the blood stock remains unaffected — minimizing data discrepancies.

4. **Role-Based Data Access and Authentication**: Through careful routing and middleware, we’ve implemented strict access control to ensure that blood banks, hospitals, and camps only see data relevant to them.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS *(Yes, we know it’s not going to win any beauty contests.)*
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL 
- **Other**: JWT,Bcrypt
